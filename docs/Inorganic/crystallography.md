> Crystalline structures are characterised by a repeating pattern in three dimensions. The periodic nature of the structure can be represented using a lattice.

## Unit Cell

The structure of a crystal can be seen as **composed of a repeated element in three dimensions**. This repeated element is known as the **unit cell**, which is the building block of the crystal structure.

<details>
    <summary>How we define a **unit cell**?</summary>

The unit cell is defined in terms of the lattice (set of identical points).

In three dimensions the unit cell is any **parallelepiped** whose vertices are lattice points, in two dimensions it is any **parallelogram** whose vertices are lattice points.
</details>

A unit cell is chosen such that it is the smallest unit cell that reflects the symmetry of the structure.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="primitive" label="Primitive" default>
    Primitive unit cells contain only one lattice point, which is made up from the lattice points at each of the corners.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="nonprimitive" label="Non-primitive">
     Non-primitive unit cells contain additional lattice points, either on a face of the unit cell or within the unit cell, and so have more than one lattice point per unit cell.
