# Introduction to Organic Chemistry

Organic chemistry is the study of compounds containing carbon, particularly focusing on their structure, properties, composition, reactions, and synthesis. This field forms the foundation for understanding biological processes and modern materials.

:::tip Historical Note
The term "organic" originally implied these compounds could only come from living organisms. This view changed in 1828 when Friedrich Wöhler synthesized urea from inorganic compounds.

## Fundamentals of Carbon Chemistry

Carbon's unique properties make it central to organic chemistry:

- Forms 4 stable covalent bonds
- Can bond with itself to form chains and rings
- Creates stable bonds with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and halogens
- Exhibits hybridization (sp³, sp², sp)

## Functional Groups

:::info
Functional groups are specific atoms or combinations of atoms that define the chemical behavior of molecules.

## Reaction Mechanisms

Organic reactions are systematic processes where molecules transform through specific pathways. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for predicting and controlling chemical reactions.

### Common Types of Mechanisms

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="addition" label="Addition Reactions">

:::info Addition Mechanism
Addition reactions occur when two molecules combine to form a single product, typically across a double bond.

**Example Reaction:**
CH₂=CH₂ + H₂O → CH₃-CH₂OH


**Where:**
- CH₂=CH₂ (ethene) - starting material with a double bond
- H₂O (water) - attacking molecule
- CH₃-CH₂OH (ethanol) - final product

:::tip Key Points
- Involves breaking a π bond
- Forms two new σ bonds
- Common in alkenes and alkynes
:::

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="substitution" label="Substitution Reactions">

:::info Substitution Mechanism
Substitution reactions involve replacing one atom or group with another.

**Example Reaction:**
CH₃-Br + OH⁻ → CH₃-OH + Br⁻

**Where:**
- CH₃-Br (methyl bromide) - starting material
- OH⁻ (hydroxide ion) - nucleophile
- CH₃-OH (methanol) - product
- Br⁻ (bromide ion) - leaving group

:::tip Key Points
- One group replaces another
- Common in alkyl halides
- Can be SN1 or SN2 type

:::note
These mechanisms are fundamental to organic chemistry and form the basis for more complex reactions.
