> Elimination reactions are **fundamental processes** in organic chemistry where a molecule loses two substituents to form a multiple bond, such as a double or triple bond. These reactions are indispensable in **organic synthesis**, enabling the creation of alkenes and alkynes, which are key building blocks in a variety of chemical and industrial applications.

## üß™ Basic Elimination Reactions

Elimination reactions can proceed through two primary mechanisms: **E1 (Elimination Unimolecular)** and **E2 (Elimination Bimolecular)**. These mechanisms differ in their kinetics, stereochemical requirements, and reaction conditions.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="E1" label="E1 Mechanism">

### üîç E1 Mechanism: Elimination Unimolecular

The **E1 mechanism** unfolds in two distinct steps:

1. **Formation of a Carbocation Intermediate (Rate-Determining Step)**:
   - The leaving group departs first, creating a carbocation.
   - This step is slow, as it requires overcoming the energy barrier to form a high-energy intermediate.

2. **Proton Loss and Alkene Formation**:
   - A base abstracts a proton (Œ≤-hydrogen) from the adjacent carbon atom.
   - The electrons from the broken C‚ÄìH bond form the œÄ bond, creating the alkene.

:::tip Key Characteristics of E1
- **First-Order Kinetics**: The reaction rate depends only on the concentration of the substrate:
  $$
  \text{Rate} = k[\text{Substrate}]
  $$
- **Favored by Polar Protic Solvents**: These solvents stabilize the carbocation intermediate and assist in ionization of the leaving group.
- **Carbocation Rearrangement Possible**: If a more stable carbocation can form via hydride or alkyl shifts, the reaction will proceed through that pathway.
- **Regioselectivity (Zaitsev's Rule)**: The major product is the more substituted alkene due to its higher thermodynamic stability.
- **Common in Weak Base Conditions**: Weak bases like water or alcohols are often sufficient.

<TabItem value="E2" label="E2 Mechanism">

### üîç E2 Mechanism: Elimination Bimolecular

The **E2 mechanism** occurs in a single, concerted step:

1. **Simultaneous Bond-Breaking and Bond-Forming**:
   - The base abstracts a Œ≤-hydrogen at the same time that the leaving group departs.
   - The electrons from the Œ≤-C‚ÄìH bond are used to form the œÄ bond, resulting in the alkene product.

:::info Important Features of E2
- **Second-Order Kinetics**: The reaction rate depends on both the substrate and base concentrations:
  $$
  \text{Rate} = k[\text{Substrate}][\text{Base}]
  $$
- **Anti-Periplanar Geometry Required**: The Œ≤-hydrogen and the leaving group must be in opposite planes (coplanar but anti-aligned) to allow proper orbital overlap for œÄ bond formation.
- **Stereospecificity**: The geometry of the substrate determines the stereochemistry of the product (e.g., E or Z alkene).
- **Favored by Strong Bases**: Bases like $$ \text{OH}^- $$, $$ \text{OR}^- $$, or bulky bases such as $$ \text{t-BuOK} $$ promote E2 mechanisms.
- **Less Likely to Rearrange**: Since no carbocation intermediate is formed, rearrangements do not occur.
- **Versatility in Substrates**: E2 reactions can occur with primary, secondary, or tertiary substrates, provided steric hindrance does not impede the base.

### ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison of E1 vs. E2 Mechanisms

| Feature                       | **E1**                                | **E2**                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Mechanism**                 | Two steps (formation of intermediate) | One step (concerted)             |
| **Kinetics**                  | First-order                           | Second-order                     |

| **Solvent Preference**        | Polar protic                          | Polar aprotic                    |
| **Stereochemistry**           | Not stereospecific                    | Stereospecific (anti-periplanar) |
| **Carbocation Rearrangement** | Possible                              | Not possible                     |

:::tip Note
- **E1 and E2 Competition**: Tertiary substrates often favor E1 in polar protic solvents due to easier carbocation formation. However, in the presence of strong bases, E2 dominates.
- **Zaitsev's Rule in Both Mechanisms**: While E1 strictly follows Zaitsev's rule due to thermodynamic control, E2 reactions may deviate if bulky bases (like tert-butoxide) are used, favoring the less substituted product (Hofmann product).

## Factors Affecting E1 & E2

### 1. Substrate Structure
- Primary vs. Secondary vs. Tertiary substrates
- Leaving group ability
- Steric hindrance

### 2. Base Strength

### 3. Solvent Effects

| Solvent Type  | Effect on Reaction |
| ------------- | ------------------ |
| Polar Protic  | Favors E1          |
| Polar Aprotic | Favors E2          |
| Non-polar     | Limited effect     |

## Competition with Substitution

Elimination reactions often compete with substitution reactions (SN1 and SN2).

:::warning Common Competition Scenarios
- E2 vs. SN2
- E1 vs. SN1

## Regioselectivity and Stereochemistry

### Zaitsev's Rule
The major product is the more substituted alkene.

- E1 can form both E and Z isomers

## Applications in Synthesis

Elimination reactions are valuable in:
- Alkene synthesis
- Natural product synthesis

- Polymer chemistry

## Practice Problems

:::note Exercise
1. Predict the major product when 2-bromopropane reacts with KOH in ethanol.
2. Compare the rates of E2 elimination for primary, secondary, and tertiary substrates.
