> Aldehydes are **fundamental carbonyl compounds** in organic chemistry characterized by a terminal C=O group. These molecules serve as **essential building blocks** in organic synthesis, natural product chemistry, and biochemical processes, playing crucial roles from industrial polymer production to cellular metabolism.

## üß™ Basic Structure and Properties

Aldehydes contain a carbonyl group (C=O) at the terminal position of a carbon chain, making them uniquely reactive due to their electronic and structural features.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="structure" label="Structure">

### üîç Electronic Structure

The carbonyl group creates distinct reactivity patterns due to:

1. **Electronic Distribution**:
   - The C=O bond is polarized due to oxygen's electronegativity
   - The carbonyl carbon is electrophilic
   - The oxygen holds a partial negative charge

2. **Resonance Effects**:
   $$
   \text{R-CH}=\text{O} \leftrightarrow \text{R-CH}^+-\text{O}^-
   $$

:::tip Key Properties
- **Boiling Points**: Higher than corresponding hydrocarbons due to dipole-dipole interactions
- **Solubility**: Smaller aldehydes are water-soluble due to hydrogen bonding
- **Reactivity**: Highly reactive toward nucleophilic addition

### üìä Spectroscopic Identification

1. **IR Spectroscopy**:
   - Strong C=O stretch at 1725-1740 cm‚Åª¬π
   - Characteristic C-H aldehyde stretch near 2720 cm‚Åª¬π (Fermi resonance)

2. **NMR Spectroscopy**:
   - ¬πH NMR: Distinctive downfield aldehyde proton (Œ¥ 9-10 ppm)
   - ¬π¬≥C NMR: Carbonyl carbon signal around Œ¥ 190-200 ppm

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="additions" label="Addition Reactions">

#### Common Nucleophilic Additions

1. **Grignard Reactions**:
   - RMgX adds to form secondary alcohols
   - Anhydrous conditions required
   $$
   \text{R-CH=O} + \text{R'-MgX} \rightarrow \text{R-CH(OH)-R'}
   $$

2. **Cyanohydrin Formation**:
   - CN‚Åª adds to form cyanohydrins
   - Reversible process
   $$
   \text{R-CH=O} + \text{CN}^- \rightarrow \text{R-CH(OH)-CN}
   $$

:::tip Important Considerations
- Temperature control is crucial
- Product stability varies with substrate
- Water-sensitive reactions require anhydrous conditions

<TabItem value="mechanisms" label="Reaction Mechanisms">

#### Mechanism Details

1. **Initial Attack**:
   - Nucleophile approaches the electrophilic carbonyl carbon
   - Forms tetrahedral intermediate

2. **Proton Transfer**:
   - Protonation of alkoxide intermediate
   - Forms final product
